# Smithery
A small game made in C about smithing medieval weapons.

The goal of the game is to generate wealth by crafting weapons with more and more fantastical materials. As you craft more weapons, your smithing ability will increase, and you will level up, allowing you to create even better weapons to sell.
The game utilizes probability curves in order to have fair but unpredictable RNG.
